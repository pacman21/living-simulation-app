LivingSimulation is an Android application that I created my senior year in college. The main portion of the code can be found in src/livingsim/com. This app has different "life levels" (Hygiene, Social, Work, Hunger, Energy, Fitness, and Fun) that decrease over time. You must log daily activities to increase your levels (I.E. take a shower to increase hygiene, and play sports to increase fitness, and fun). If preferred, you can also log your activities to your Facebook account.

----------------------------------------------------

Objective of the Game
----------------------------------------------------
     
	To live your life to the fullest by completing activities and making sure your Life Level is in the green.

----------------------------------------------------

Important Parts of the Game 

----------------------------------------------------

Lifetime Points

Gaining Lifetime Points
----------------------------------------------------
There are many different ways to get Permanent Life Points (Lifetime Points). These differ from Life Points because Life Points decrease while Lifetime Points do not. You gain Lifetime points by how many Life Levels you have at the end of your day. The more Life Level points you have the more Lifetime Points you receive. You receive 2 Lifetime points for every Life Level you are above 6. So for example: If your Work Life Level is at 8, you will receive 2 Lifetime Points for that day. The Lifetime points are calculated when you start your sleep. You can select Sleep once every 10 hours.

Losing Lifetime Points/Death 
----------------------------------------------------
Every great game has a way to win and a way to lose. “Death” is the way to lose Living Simulation. In death, the user will lose all of their Lifetime Points and their Life Level will reset. There are a few ways to die. The first way to die would be to have three of your Life Levels down to zero. The second way to die would be to have all of your Life Levels below 4. The third way to die would be to not log on to the app in 7 days OR to not click the Sleep button in 7 days. 

There is also a way to lose points. If you are not gaining points then you are losing points. For each Life Level that is below 4 (with the exception of Energy), you will lose that many points. For example: If Fitness is at Life Level 2, then you will lose 2 points.

----------------------------------------------------
Life Level
----------------------------------------------------
A Life Level is the measurement tool that tells you whether you are living a “good” life according to the definition of a good life applied by the game. The Life Level is a rectangle that displays different colors and has different tiers. The top tier is colored Green, this means that this portion of your life is in good shape. The middle tier is colored Yellow, this means that this portion of your life is in mediocre shape. The lowest tier is colored Red, this means that this portion of your life is in not so good shape. In a Life Level there are 9 points. You get x amount of points for completing an activity to a maximum of 9 points. You can go to a minimum of 0 points.

----------------------------------------------------
Types of Life Levels
----------------------------------------------------
There will be different types of Life Levels. Some examples of the types of Life Levels that will be included are Hygiene, Social, Work, Hunger, Energy, Fitness, and Fun. These Life Levels will be explained in further detail later in this document.

----------------------------------------------------
Hygiene
----------------------------------------------------
This part of the Life Levels tells you how clean you are. For example: The average American showers once per day, brushes their teeth at least once a day, washing your hands after each time you use the bathroom and flosses/uses rinse at least one a day. To increase your Hygiene in this game, you will have to brush your teeth, floss/rinse or take a shower. Taking a shower will increase your Hygiene by 5 points, Brushing your teeth will increase your Hygiene by 2 points, Flossing/rinsing will increase your Hygiene by 1 point. Washing your hands after you use the bathroom will increase your Hygiene by 1 point (max 1 point per day for washing hands). Hygiene will decrease at a rate of .25 points every hour.

----------------------------------------------------
Social
----------------------------------------------------
This part of the Life Levels tells you how Social you are. You should be socializing for at least 2 hours a day. We will include many different activities in the category of socializing. For example: If you eat lunch with a work buddy, you will be given 3 Social Life Points for that. If you eat dinner with your family, you will be given 3 Social Life Points for that also. You will also be granted Social Life Points for every hour you socializing with others whether it be playing an online video game with friends or going outside to play. Social points will decrease by a rate of .5 points every hour.

----------------------------------------------------
Work/Education
----------------------------------------------------
If you have a job of any kind, this is probably the easiest Life Level to fill. You will be awarded full points for working. Every day you work you will be given 4 Life Points. Every day that you don’t work you will be negated 1 Life Points. If you are a student, you may include this also. 

----------------------------------------------------
Hunger
----------------------------------------------------
This is also a fairly easy Life Level to fill. To fill this Life Level you must eat at least three times a day. While you are sleeping the hours in between your eating habits will not be taken into effect. Every time you eat a full meal you will be awarded 9 points. You will be awarded 1 point for a snack. Your hunger will decrease by 1 point every hour. 

----------------------------------------------------
Energy
----------------------------------------------------
The amount of hours of sleep an average American gets is 7 hours. If you sleep 7 hours you will receive 9 Life Points. Your Energy will decrease by .5 points every hour. You will log when you are starting to go to sleep, the game will give you 30 minutes to fall asleep. You will then log when you awake which will then calculate how many hours you sleep and how many Life Points you receive for energy.

----------------------------------------------------
Fitness
----------------------------------------------------
The amount of exercise the average adult should do in a day is 30 minutes of exercise. If you complete 30 minutes of exercise you will be awarded the full 9 Life Points. You receive 1/3 Life Points for every minute you spend exercising. Life points will decrease by 1/3 Life Points every hour. 

----------------------------------------------------
Fun
----------------------------------------------------
The amount of fun you should have is about 3 hours a day. You will receive 4 points for having fun doing social activities such as playing a sport, or drinking with friends. You will receive 3 points for having fun doing solo activities such as playing video games or playing on the computer. 


----------------------------------------------------
User Created Activity
----------------------------------------------------
This functionality of the program will allow the user to create mew activities in the instance of the game. This will also allow users to create “Routines” such as your early morning Routine which may encompass, taking a shower, brushing your teeth, etc. Routines can be selected instead of selecting each activity individually. This will result in better use friendliness. The user can also create their own activity. The form will include Name of Activity, and all of the life levels with a text box next to them. The user can select the effect of the activity on Life Levels. 

----------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------
Keep in mind that many activities will span through many different Life Levels. For example: Going out to dinner with a few friends will span through the Life Levels of Hunger, Social and Fun. Playing sports with friends will span through the Life Levels of Social, Fitness and Fun. This is a work in progress and these numbers are not set in stone and they may change every day.
